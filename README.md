# Benefits
This design has many benefits including the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>No soldering required: Increase safety as there are less metals around the workspace to cause a short. Lighter overall weight due to plastic scaffolding. Known ampacity using tried and true wire guages as opposed to sheets of metal with less known ampacities.</li>
  <li>Easily scales up: The batteries can be connected in 3 dimensions so you can easily build a battery pack of great capacity while keeping everything connected.</li>
  <li>NiMh chemistry: Sorry but I'm not going to melt my face off or burn down my house building large Li-Ion batteries in the basement. NiMh chemistry is non toxic, readily available, less reactive, easier to manage.</li>
</ul>

# Example
The following image demonstrates using the AAA connector and cap models to create a 60V (nominal), 66Wh battery pack.
