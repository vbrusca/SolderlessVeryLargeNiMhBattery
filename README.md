# Benefits
This design has many benefits including the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>No soldering required: Increase safety as there are less metals around the workspace to cause a short. Lighter overall weight due to plastic scaffolding. Known ampacity using tried and true wire guages as opposed to sheets of metal with less known ampacities.</li>
  <li>Easily scales up: The batteries can be connected in 3 dimensions so you can easily build a battery pack of great capacity while keeping everything connected.</li>
  <li>NiMh chemistry: NiMh chemistry is non toxic, readily available, less reactive, easier to manage. No thermal runaway!</li>
  <li>Passively Cooled: The battery pack as designed, is perfectly suited at passive cooling with lots of space for air movement at the cost of density and overall size.</li>
</ul>

# Example
The following image demonstrates using the AAA connector and cap models to create a 60V (nominal), 60Wh battery pack, out of 50 AAA batteries in series.

The models have been posted for both AAA and AA cells. You'll have to run some test prints to get the right settings for your printer.
Here are some sample battery packs built using this approach.

600Wh at 60V using 200 AA NiMh rechargeable batteries:

360Wh at 60V using 300 AAA NiMh rechargeable batteries:

A look at the caps up close. The caps are slotted to aid in the alignment of the zip tie. The zip tie is used to keep a row, in this case 6 NiMh batteries in series, connected together,
and connected to the next row. I recommend using two leads at the terminals of the battery pack that are not connected to the larger battery structure. This allows you to run checks and tests against each "cell" in the larger pack. It is recommended to use color coded caps that match the polarity of the battery terminal it connects to.

Build some super large NiMh batteries and see what you can power with them. Free up valuable Li-Ion resources by using NiMh where NiMh does well/better than Li-Ion.
Enjoy!!
