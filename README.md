# Benefits
This design has many benefits including the following:<br>
<ul>
  <li>No soldering required: Increase safety as there are less metals around the workspace to cause a short. Lighter overall weight due to plastic scaffolding. Known ampacity using tried and true wire guages as opposed to sheets of metal with less known ampacities.</li>
  <li>Easily scales up: The batteries can be connected in 3 dimensions so you can easily build a battery pack of great capacity while keeping everything connected.</li>
  <li>NiMh chemistry: NiMh chemistry is non toxic, readily available, less reactive, easier to manage. No thermal runaway!</li>
  <li>Passively Cooled: The battery pack as designed, is perfectly suited at passive cooling with lots of space for air movement at the cost of density and overall size.</li>
</ul>

# Example
The following image demonstrates using the AAA connector and cap models to create a 60V (nominal), 60Wh battery pack.

The models have been posted for both AAA and AA cells. You'll have to run some test prints to get the right settings for your printer.
Here are some sample battery packs built using this approach.
